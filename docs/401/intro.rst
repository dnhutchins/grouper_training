Introduction

The TIER Access Governance Practicum (401) describes a series of real world
access governance use cases that students can use to demonstrate knowledge
of how to translate natural language policy into the appropriate digital
policy in Grouper. The access governance practicum incorporates much of the
TIER IAM suite of components and provides a “full TIER stack” experience.

The Practicum consists of 4 labs that will allow students to apply knowledge
they have learned from other Grouper courses.  They will present real-world
access control scenarios.  Instructors will present techniques and possible
solutions to these problems.
