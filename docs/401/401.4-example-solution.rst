401.4 Untangling Legacy Access Policies - Example Solution
==========================================================

The follwing solution uses techniques demonstrated in the other 401 series
labs in order to create an independent policy for the LMS service.

#. Use Grouper Loader to import existing LDAP cohort group into a "community
   members" reference group-- `ref:legacy:community_members`
#. Add loader job to populate `communtiy_members` from
   `cn=community_members,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=edu`.
#. Run loader job to import members into reference group.
#. Create a Grouper service folder for the LMS with a policy for LMS
   authorization: `app:lms:lms_authorize|allow|deny`
#. Add the "institutional people" reference group, `ref:community_members`,
    to the allow policy for the LMS, `app:lms:lms_allow`.
#. Create `app:lms:ref:visiting_scholars`.  Import the NetIDs for the visiting
   scholors into this reference group.
#. Add `visiting_scholars` to `lms_allow`.
#. Provision this policy to a new group in the LDAP DIT that the LMS group can
   use to allow access to the service.
