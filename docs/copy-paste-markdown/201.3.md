# eduPerson Affiliation for Authorization


## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to do subject attributes management with policy groups
- Configure provisioning to reflect group membership (aka subject attributes) into OpenLDAP
- Configure Shibboleth to release eduPersonAffiliation for loosely defined authorization use cases

## Hands on

### Create a new application template

* Navigate to the _app_ folder
* create a new application (More actions -> New template -> Application)
    - Key: `eduPersonAffiliation`
    - Description:

        ```eduPersonAffiliation (defined in eduPerson 1.0); OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.5923.1.1.1.1 Specifies the person's relationship(s) to the institution in broad categories such as student, faculty, staff, alum, etc.```

### Create app folder for eduPersonAffiliation

* Assign object type “policy” to the _service:policy_ folder
* Create the following groups in app:eduPersonAffiliation:service:policy
    - student
    - faculty
    - staff

### Add reference groups to policy

The eduPerson specification states: "...each institution will decide the criteria for membership in each affiliation classification. What is desirable is that a reasonable person should find an institution’s definition of affiliation plausible"

* Add _ref:student:students_ to the policy for _student_
* Add the _All Staff_ reference group to _staff_
* Add the _All Faculty_ reference group to _faculty_

The eduPerson specification states: "The 'member' affiliation MUST be asserted for people carrying one or more of the following affiliations: faculty or staff or student or employee"

* Create new group under app:eduPersonAffiliation:service:policy
    - name: `member`
* Add faculty, staff, and student to member
* Visualize the new _member_ group

### Configure external system for provisioning

Provisioning targets depend on an external system that includes basic connection and configuration. For this lesson, the LDAP system has already been set up with config id "demo".

* Navigate to Miscellaneous > External Systems.
* Location entry for "demo"
* Under Actions, view the details, then test the system


### Configure (review) provisioner

A provisioner has already been set up, “eduPersonAffiliation”. Review its properties

* Go to Miscellaneous -> Provisioning -> eduPersonAffiliation -> Actions -> Edit provisioner


### Create a full sync provisioning job (TODO may already be set up)

The provisioner exists, but needs to have either a full sync or incremental job to perform the provisioning.

* Go to Miscellaneous -> Daemon jobs
* Under More actions, choose Add daemon
* Create a job called ePA_full_sync, of type Provisioning full sync
    - Config id: `ePA_full_sync`
    - Enable: Yes
    - Daemon type: Provisioning full sync
    - Provisioner config id: *eduPersonAffiliation*
    - Quartz cron: `0 0 4 * * ?`

### Configure provisioning on folder

* Navigate back to the _app:eduPersonAffiliation:service:policy_ folder.

* Under More actions, choose Provisioning 
* Assign the new provisioner
    Target name: ePA
    Type: Yes
    Provision: Yes
    Folder scope: All objects in the folder or subfolder

### Run provisioner job

* In Miscellaneous -> Daemon jobs, look for job _OTHER\_JOB\_ePA\_full\_sync_
* Under job actions, choose *Run job now*
* Click on the hyperlink for the job to go to the job log
* Click on *Apply filter* until the job completes

### Verify Provisioning results

* From the GTE Jump page (https://localhost:8443/) launch the LDAP manager and login.
* Verify that subjects in the _member_ group now have a "member" affiliation in the LDAP record (e.g. uid=aadams)

### Configure Shib to release ePA

* Open a private browser, and log in to https://localhost:8443/app with username _aadams_ and password _password_
* Look at value for _eduPersonAffiliation_
